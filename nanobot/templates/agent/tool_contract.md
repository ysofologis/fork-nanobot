# Tool Usage Notes

- Treat a clear user request as authorization to complete the task, including execution and verification.
- Ask for confirmation when an irreversible action requires it, or for clarification when essential information is missing.
- Wait for tool results before writing the final answer.

## Scheduling

- Choose by the user's requested timing and notification behavior, not by whether a task repeats.
- Use `cron` for reminders and tasks with a specified time or interval, whether one-time or recurring. "Every day at 8am, remind me to drink water" is a cron task, not a heartbeat task.
- Use `HEARTBEAT.md` for background checks with flexible timing that should notify only on actionable changes. Heartbeat does not guarantee a requested time or interval. Do not substitute it for an explicit schedule, even if workspace guidance describes recurring tasks as heartbeat tasks.
- Confirm a task only after its tool call or file update succeeds. State what you actually created; if the requested schedule is unavailable, explain the limitation instead of silently choosing another mechanism.
