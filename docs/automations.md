# Automations

<!-- Meta description: Create, run, and manage nanobot scheduled automations, local triggers, and heartbeat-backed background checks. -->

Automations are agent turns that run later in a linked topic. Use them
when nanobot should do work without someone actively typing: reminders,
recurring checks, nightly summaries, CI follow-ups, local script reports, or
webhook-driven events.

Create automations from the chat channel or WebUI topic where the
result should appear. That lets nanobot keep the right session history,
workspace, and reply target.

## Choose an Automation Type

| Type | Starts from | Best for | Created with |
|---|---|---|---|
| Scheduled automation | Time, interval, or cron expression | Recurring reminders, scheduled summaries, one-time future tasks | Ask nanobot in the target topic to schedule it with the `cron` tool |
| Local trigger | A local `nanobot trigger ...` command | CI jobs, webhooks, shell scripts, generated reports | `/trigger <name>` in the target topic |
| Heartbeat | Protected system schedule | Quiet recurring checks that should only report useful results | Edit `<workspace>/HEARTBEAT.md` |

The two user-created automation types are scheduled automations and local
triggers. Heartbeat uses the same background service but is system-managed and
protected from normal automation edits.

## Before You Create One

Keep `nanobot gateway` running. The gateway owns background delivery for chat
apps, WebUI topics, scheduled automations, local triggers, heartbeat, and
Dream jobs.

Use the same workspace and config for the gateway and any process that sends
local trigger messages. If you run multiple nanobot instances, pass the matching
`--config` or `--workspace` option to `nanobot trigger`.

Create each automation from the target topic. An automation without a linked
topic cannot be enabled or run from the WebUI because nanobot would not know
where to deliver the turn.

## Scheduled Automations

Scheduled automations are created by the agent's `cron` tool. In practice, ask
nanobot from the target chat or WebUI topic:

```text
Every weekday at 9am, check open pull requests and summarize blockers here.
```

or:

```text
Tomorrow at 4pm, remind me to send the release notes.
```

The cron tool supports interval schedules, cron expressions, and one-time
scheduled tasks. Cron expressions can include an IANA timezone such as
`America/Vancouver`; otherwise nanobot uses the runtime default timezone.

Scheduled automations normally deliver the result back to the session where they
were created. Use them for work that should run on a predictable schedule and
report each run.

Write what the task should do, such as "Remind me to drink water". nanobot sends
the final reply to the task's saved chat. You do not need to put a channel, chat
ID, or a `message` tool call in the instructions for that reply.

For separate sends, specify the recipients in the instructions. The agent can
still use `message` to send to other chats, send to several recipients, or attach
files. Existing tasks that explicitly request this tool remain supported.

For background checks that should stay quiet unless there is something useful to
report, use heartbeat instead of a user-created scheduled automation.

Repetition alone does not select heartbeat. "Every day at 8am, remind me to
drink water" needs a cron schedule. "Keep an eye on open issues and tell me
when one needs attention" can use heartbeat if the check time is flexible.
Heartbeat does not guarantee a requested time or interval.

An upgrade does not overwrite your workspace's `AGENTS.md` or convert existing
heartbeat entries into cron jobs. The current scheduling rules are included in
the system prompt. If an old workspace rule directs all recurring tasks to
heartbeat, update that rule too. To correct an existing reminder, remove its old
heartbeat entry and create the cron task once. Check the task list to avoid duplicates.

## Local Triggers

Local triggers let a local script or external service send a message into a
specific nanobot session later.

Create the trigger from the chat or WebUI topic where future messages should
arrive:

```text
/trigger PR review
```

nanobot replies with a trigger ID and a command shaped like:

```bash
nanobot trigger trg_8K4P2Q9X "Review PR #4502"
```

Replace the quoted text with the message nanobot should receive. For generated
or longer content, pipe stdin:

```bash
generate-report | nanobot trigger trg_8K4P2Q9X
```

For multiple instances, use the same config or workspace selector as the
gateway:

```bash
nanobot trigger --config ./bot-a/config.json trg_8K4P2Q9X "Nightly report"
nanobot trigger --workspace ./bot-a/workspace trg_8K4P2Q9X "Nightly report"
```

nanobot does not provide a built-in public webhook receiver for local triggers.
If GitHub, CI, or another external system should wake nanobot, run your own
small webhook service and have it call `nanobot trigger` after it builds the
final message.

## Heartbeat

Heartbeat is for recurring workspace checks that should usually stay quiet. It
reads `<workspace>/HEARTBEAT.md`, executes active tasks, and sends only useful or
actionable results to the most recently active chat target.

Use heartbeat for checks such as "watch this repo for important failures" or
"periodically inspect this workspace and only tell me when action is needed." Use
a scheduled automation instead when every run should produce a visible reminder
or report.

Heartbeat is enabled by default when `nanobot gateway` starts. Configure it in
[`configuration.md#gateway-heartbeat`](./configuration.md#gateway-heartbeat).

## Manage Automations

Use the WebUI Automations view to:

- filter by all, active, paused, needs-attention, or system jobs;
- search by task name, message, trigger command, linked topic, schedule, or
  status;
- sort by next run, last run, updated time, or name;
- run scheduled automations now;
- pause or resume, rename, or delete user-created automations;
- copy the CLI command for local triggers;
- inspect protected system automations without changing them.

Local triggers do not have a WebUI "Run now" action because each run needs a
message. Copy the `nanobot trigger ...` command from the WebUI and replace
`"message"` with the content that should be delivered.

### Change the Chat for a Scheduled Task

Open a scheduled task in **Automations**. **Run and reply in** shows its saved chat,
with the channel logo and name. WebUI chats use the same display names as the
sidebar. A renamed chat keeps its identity and task binding. Chats with the same
name show an `@handle` to help you tell them apart.

To change the chat:

1. Select another chat from **Run and reply in**.
2. Review the task instructions, which are read-only by default. If they need
   changes, select **Edit instructions**. Remove recipients you no longer want,
   but keep intended separate sends. Members of the new chat can see future task messages and results.
3. Select **Confirm change**. Wait for the saved confirmation.

If you edit the instructions, the button becomes **Save and change**. Both
changes are saved together; nothing is saved when you select **Edit instructions**.
To change the task name or schedule, use **Edit** in the task details instead.

Select **Cancel** before saving to return to the task without changes. After a
successful save, select **Change back to** to review a return to the previous
chat. You must confirm this change too. You can also select a previous chat from
the list later. This changes future runs; it does not recall messages already sent.

Future runs use the new chat's history and reply there by default. Previous
messages stay in their original chat. Previous run results remain available.
Changing the chat does not run the task, enable it, or change its schedule.

You can discuss each new result in that same chat. Background task results also
return there. If you delete that chat, nanobot asks you to confirm deletion of
its scheduled tasks as well. Cancelling the deletion keeps the chat and tasks.

The list contains existing chats on the same gateway with the same effective
workspace and access mode. Chat-app targets need a running channel and a saved
reply route from an earlier incoming message. If a chat is missing, send nanobot
a message there and check that its channel is running. Raw recipient IDs,
cross-host moves, unified sessions, system jobs, and local triggers are not
supported by this selector. An older gateway keeps the existing read-only view.

If a scheduled turn is running or queued, wait for it to finish before changing
the chat. The current scheduler also rejects a change while another scheduled
turn is active. If another editor changes the task, reopen the task and review
the latest instructions. A rejected save leaves the draft visible.

This changes the whole task chat, not a separate forwarding address. Explicit
`message` tool instructions can still send elsewhere. Shared workspace files
and memory remain shared; changing the chat does not create a new security boundary.
The confirmation screen lets you edit instructions such as "send to the original
chat" before you save. nanobot does not silently rewrite those instructions.

### Back Up Before Downgrading

Chat changes store a binding version and the session used by each previous run.
Existing jobs do not need a manual migration when upgrading. Older nanobot
versions can discard these new fields when they write the cron store. After a
chat change, that can make old run results unavailable in the WebUI and remove
protection against stale CLI updates.

Before trying this feature, stop the gateway and other cron writers, then back
up the complete cron directory in the active instance's data directory. For a
downgrade after changing a chat, stop those processes again and restore that
coherent pre-change cron backup. This also restores the old schedules and task
settings; later changes are not included. Chat messages are not moved or deleted.

## Delivery and Reliability

Automation delivery is workspace-local. Scheduled jobs and local trigger
deliveries use the same workspace as the gateway.

Local trigger messages are written to a durable queue. If the gateway is not
running yet, the message waits in that workspace. If the linked topic is
already running a turn, the trigger waits until the session becomes idle instead
of being injected into the active turn.

The local trigger queue is at-least-once, not exactly-once. If the gateway exits
after claiming a delivery but before the linked turn completes, the next gateway
start requeues that delivery. External scripts should make repeated trigger
messages safe. If the delivery reaches the agent and the turn fails, the
delivery is marked failed instead of retrying forever.

Each local trigger delivery writes an audit record under
`<workspace>/triggers/runs`. Run one gateway consumer per workspace; the local
queue is not a distributed multi-consumer queue.

## Common Patterns

For a nightly report, ask from the target topic:

```text
Every night at 9pm, review today's workspace changes and summarize anything I should handle tomorrow.
```

For a CI follow-up, create a trigger once:

```text
/trigger CI follow-up
```

Then have your CI or webhook adapter call:

```bash
nanobot trigger <trigger-id> "Build failed on main. Inspect the logs and suggest the next fix."
```

For a local report script:

```bash
generate-report | nanobot trigger <trigger-id>
```

## Troubleshooting

If an automation does not run, check that `nanobot gateway` is running, the
automation is enabled, and it was created from a linked topic.

If a local trigger waits forever, confirm the command uses the same workspace or
config as the gateway.

If a trigger message appears twice after a restart, treat it as expected
at-least-once delivery and make the external message idempotent.

If you need to edit, pause, resume, rename, delete, or inspect automations, use
the WebUI Automations view.
