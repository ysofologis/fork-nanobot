# nanobot Docs

For published release documentation, visit [nanobot.wiki](https://nanobot.wiki/docs/latest/getting-started/nanobot-overview). The pages in this directory track the current repository and may describe features that have not reached the published site yet.

If you have never used a terminal or edited a config file before, start with [`start-without-technical-background.md`](./start-without-technical-background.md). Otherwise, start with [`quick-start.md`](./quick-start.md) and get one local `nanobot agent -m "Hello!"` reply working before connecting chat apps, WebUI, Docker, or custom tools.

Most JSON examples in these docs are snippets to merge into `~/.nanobot/config.json`, not full replacement files.

Provider examples are concrete walkthroughs, not rankings or endorsements. Use the provider whose key, endpoint, and model ID you actually control.

If you find a docs mistake, outdated command, or confusing step, please open an issue: <https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot/issues>.

| Comfortable pasting commands and JSON | [`quick-start.md`](./quick-start.md) | [`provider-cookbook.md`](./provider-cookbook.md) for pasteable provider setups |
| Operating a long-running bot | [`concepts.md`](./concepts.md) | [`chat-apps.md`](./chat-apps.md), [`webui.md`](./webui.md), and [`deployment.md`](./deployment.md) |
| Integrating or extending nanobot | [`architecture.md`](./architecture.md) | [`configuration.md`](./configuration.md), [`openai-api.md`](./openai-api.md), [`python-sdk.md`](./python-sdk.md), [`development.md`](./development.md), and [`channel-plugin-guide.md`](./channel-plugin-guide.md) |

## Start Here

| Goal | Read | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| Start with no technical background | [`start-without-technical-background.md`](./start-without-technical-background.md) | One-command setup, terminal basics, config, API keys, and the first reply |
| Install and get the first reply | [`quick-start.md`](./quick-start.md) | A working CLI agent and a known-good config path |
| Understand how the pieces fit | [`concepts.md`](./concepts.md) | Mental model for config, workspace, gateway, channels, tools, memory, and sessions |

| Fix a first-run or runtime problem | [`troubleshooting.md`](./troubleshooting.md) | A diagnosis order and targeted checks for common failures |

## After the First Reply Works

Do not configure everything at once. Pick one next surface:

If a local `nanobot agent` session can already answer normally, you can also ask nanobot to help configure itself: have it read the relevant docs, inspect your current config, make one specific next change, and tell you when to run `/restart`.

| Next goal | Read | First check |
|---|---|---|
| Use nanobot in a browser | [`webui.md`](./webui.md) | Enable WebSocket, run `nanobot gateway`, open `http://127.0.0.1:8765` |
| Talk through a chat app | [`chat-apps.md`](./chat-apps.md) | Merge one channel snippet, run `nanobot channels status`, keep `nanobot gateway` running |
| Change provider or add fallbacks | [`provider-cookbook.md`](./provider-cookbook.md) | Keep `modelPresets` named and set `agents.defaults.modelPreset` |
| Call nanobot from Python | [`python-sdk.md`](./python-sdk.md) | Reuse the same config/workspace from code, then run or stream one agent turn |
| Understand before operating long-term | [`concepts.md`](./concepts.md) | Know what config, workspace, gateway, sessions, memory, and tools mean |
| Diagnose a new failure | [`troubleshooting.md`](./troubleshooting.md) | Start with `nanobot status`, then `nanobot agent -m "Hello!"` |

## Use nanobot

| Use slash commands and periodic tasks | [`chat-commands.md`](./chat-commands.md) | Pairing, model presets, heartbeat tasks, and chat-side controls |
| Generate images | [`image-generation.md`](./image-generation.md) | Image provider config, WebUI image mode, and artifact behavior |
| Run several isolated bots | [`multiple-instances.md`](./multiple-instances.md) | Separate configs, workspaces, ports, and sessions |

## Reading Strategy

Use the docs in this order when you are unsure where to go:

1. If terminal commands or config files are new to you, [`start-without-technical-background.md`](./start-without-technical-background.md) explains the setup words and uses one concrete provider example so there is only one decision at a time.
2. [`quick-start.md`](./quick-start.md) proves installation, config loading, and provider access.
3. [`concepts.md`](./concepts.md) explains the runtime model so later pages are easier to scan.
4. [`provider-cookbook.md`](./provider-cookbook.md) gives pasteable provider, fallback, local model, and Langfuse recipes.
5. A task guide, such as [`chat-apps.md`](./chat-apps.md), [`image-generation.md`](./image-generation.md), or [`deployment.md`](./deployment.md), gets one workflow working.
6. [`configuration.md`](./configuration.md) is the source of truth when you need a specific field, default value, or advanced option.
7. [`troubleshooting.md`](./troubleshooting.md) helps isolate whether a failure is install, config, provider, gateway, channel, or tool related.
